        <h4>THE HARVEST RAIN TEAM WERE PROMPT, PROFESSIONAL, AND DID QUALITY WORK.</h4>
        <p>Matt, Denver, and the Harvest Rain team were prompt, professional, and did quality work. They knew their stuff and were always available to discuss our project and answer any questions we had. The crew showed up on time and got the job done quickly and correctly. When our builder requested a change in the pipe layout, they changed it without complaint. This rain tank was for our business, but well certainly use Harvest Rain again in the future when we build our house. We would definitely recommend them to anyone!
<br><br>-LAMAR S.</p>

<h4>THEY WORKED HARD AND EFFICIENTLY AND WERE A DELIGHT TO HAVE AROUND.</h4>
<p>Communication at a fair price, Harvest Rain is the company to call. I was impressed from the beginning by the sales manager, Josh, who came out to evaluate my situation and wishes. Josh was super knowledgeable and designed an excellent system, which is working perfectly. Scott, the construction manager, was also super knowledgeable and made himself available all throughout the process. I cant say enough about the crew who completed the work either. They worked HARD and efficiently and were a delight to have around; happy workers who were super courteous. If I could give this company 10 stars I would. If only all the other contractors Ive worked with were as dedicated to excellence as Harvest Rain.

  <h4>YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH HARVEST RAIN!</h4>
  <p>We are very happy with our new rain harvesting system. When ever it rains we chant, fill the tank! The whole experience was great from working with James on the resale discussions, Josh on the pre installation and post installation instructional walk through and finally Aaron who lead the installation crew. Extremely professional crew. I picked Harvest Rain because I know Dripping Springs uses a lot of rain harvesting systems and I wanted a company who primary business was harvesting systems, not water wells. I also wanted a company who has done a significant number of installs. You cant go wrong with Harvest Rain!

    <br><br>-CATHERINE B</p>

    <h4>I RECOMMEND HARVEST RAIN WITHOUT HESITATION.</h4>
    <p>James, Josh, Aaron and crew did exactly what they promised and when they promised. My best example happened during a sudden downpour in the trenching stage. The crew packed up to leave, which was reasonable. But as they started to leave, rain stopped, so the crew unpacked and finished the day. This was the type commitment we received from sale to booting system. I recommend Harvest Rain without hesitation, and rainwater collection as well.

         <p>I was impressed with knowledge of the staff from my first contact, to the installation, to final set up. Any time I had a question they were able to answer it quickly. The installation crew was great and did a good job on cleanup at the end of the job. </p>

         <p>We've had our whole house rainwater collection system for about 10 years and Harvest Rain and their staff have helped us multiple times with upgrades, repairs, and often just accurate and helpful advice. I would highly recommend them for installation and service for any rainwater system</p>
